ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mikebramble

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in applying laboratory and remote sensing techniques to quantify the composition and physical properties of planetary surfaces.

ðŸŒ± I believe that the data collected by NASA's spacecraft should be easily and freely accessible. I hope to share information here that aids in the processing, calibration, and analysis steps for spectroscopic data sets that cannot be found elsewhere in the published literature.
